# APIQUINAS - Aquinas API

Inspired by famous APIs like that one that delives Kayne West wisdom or that other one that tells you Dad jokes..., I wanted to do my share and build an API that could deliver content that its normaly overlooked but it's full of wisdom. Stop looking at ancient Greek stoics and epicureans, and dwelve in it's superation (Aufhebung?):

APIQUINAS will feed you with some of the best ideas from European Medieval Philosophy.

I do hope that you can learn from those great thinkers as much as I did.
